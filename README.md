Discord theme for the Visual Refresh, all credits for the basis of my themes are in the .css files.
Themes will always need BetterDiscord ( https://betterdiscord.app ) or vencord/vesktop ( https://vencord.dev / https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop ) if you are on linux like I am your only choice is vesktop.
